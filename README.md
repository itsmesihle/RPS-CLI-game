A clean, modular, and fully logged Rock–Paper–Scissors game written in **Python**, featuring:

- User vs Computer CLI gameplay
- Score tracking
- CSV game-logging with timestamps
- Terminal ASCII-art welcome screen
- Input validation & robust structure

This project demonstrates solid beginner-to-intermediate Python skills, including modular design, input validation, file handling, and automated testing with pytest.

## 📌 **Project Description**

This is a console-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game where the welcomes the user with ASCII-art. The user is then prompted to select the number of rounds they would like to play:

![An image of the ASCII-art welcome screen.](<./images/Screenshot%20(782).png> "ASCII-art welcome")

At this point the user is asked to select either rock, paper or scissors:

- **(r)** rock
- **(p)** paper
- **(s)** scissors

The computer randomly selects one of the three options, after which:

- The winner is determined

![Winner is determined](<./images/Screenshot%20(783).png> "Winner is determined")

- The round is logged with timestamp, scores and results into `RPS_game_data.csv`

After the set number of rounds, a final scoreboard summary is displayed. After which the `RPS_game_date.csv` is saved, closed and stored on the local computer.

## ▶️ **How to Run the game, and the tests**

1. Navigate to your project:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

2. Install or update Python (≥3.8) on Windows:

```bash
# --- Install Python ---

winget install Python.Python.3
```

OR

```bash
# --- Upgrade Python ---

winget upgrade Python.Python.3
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
# --- Automatically install using requirements.txt ---

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

OR

```bash
# --- Manually install ---

pip install pyfiglet pytest
```

4. Run the game:

```bash
python project.py
```

5. Run the tests:

```bash
pytest test_project.py
```

## 📝 **Status of Project**

This RPS game is still being worked on, constantly being updated

### **Future Improvements**

- Add timeout function similar to setTimeout() in JS, that automatically quits if user is inactive
- ASCII-art disappears after 5 seconds on the terminal (the system in the background clears the screen after x seconds)
- Add difficulty modes
- Add a graphical UI (Tkinter or web-based)
- Add analytics dashboard from CSV
- Add persistent user profiles
- Replace ASCII-art with animated output
- Refactor logic for greater testability
