A clean, modular, and fully logged Rock–Paper–Scissors game written in **Python**, featuring:

- User vs Computer CLI gameplay
- Score tracking
- CSV game-logging with timestamps
- Terminal ASCII-art welcome screen
- Input validation & robust structure

This project demonstrates solid beginner-to-intermediate Python skills, including modular design, input validation, file handling, and automated testing with pytest.

## 📌 **Project Description**

This is a console-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game where the welcomes the user with ASCII-art. The user is then prompted to select the number of rounds they would like to play:

![An image of the ASCII-art welcome screen.](<./images/Screenshot%20(782).png> "ASCII-art welcome")

At this point the user is asked to select either rock, paper or scissors:

- **(r)** rock
- **(p)** paper
- **(s)** scissors

The computer randomly selects one of the three options, after which:

- The winner is determined

![Winner is determined](<./images/Screenshot%20(783).png> "Winner is determined")

- The round is logged with timestamp, scores and results into `RPS_game_data.csv`

After the set number of rounds, a final scoreboard summary is displayed. After which the `RPS_game_date.csv` is saved, closed and stored on the local computer.
